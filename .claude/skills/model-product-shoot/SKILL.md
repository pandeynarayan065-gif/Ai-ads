name: model-product-shoot
description: Run when the user wants to create a lifestyle or editorial shot of a model interacting with or holding a product — not a selfie or UGC format. Takes a reference image showing the desired scene style, a product image, and a styled model. Composites all three into a single campaign-quality image using GPT Image 2.5 Sunburst. Output saved under the active brand folder.

# Model Product Shoot

> **Folders**: before writing anything, create any folder this skill writes to with `mkdir -p` (all paths live under `brands/[brand-name]/`).


Places a styled model and a product into a reference scene. The reference image drives the composition, framing, and lighting — the model and product are swapped in while preserving everything else.

Four images passed to GPT Image 2.5 Sunburst in this order:
1. **Reference image** — composition, framing, lighting
2. **Product image** — the product to feature
3. **Model headshot** — model identity reference
4. **Styled model image** — clothing and body reference

Output saved to `./brands/[brand-name]/generation/model-product-shoot/[output-name]/`.

---

## Step 1 — Select brand

Scan `./brands/` for brand subfolders.

- **One brand found:** use it automatically and confirm: "Using brand: [name]"
- **Multiple brands found:** list them and ask which to use
- **None found:** ask the user for their brand name, slug it (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces) and create `brands/[brand-name]/intelligence/product-images/`. Ask them to drop a few clean product photos into that folder if this skill needs a product.

---

## Step 2 — Create reference folder and collect reference image

Create the shared composition references folder:
```bash
mkdir -p brands/[brand-name]/generation/model-product-shoot/composition-references
```

List any images already in the folder. If empty, tell the user:

> "I need a **reference image** — this is a photo showing the kind of scene, framing, and lighting you want. It could be a model holding a product on a track, applying something post-workout, or any lifestyle scene that fits the vibe. The model and product in the reference don't matter — I'll swap them out.
>
> Drop it into:
> `brands/[brand-name]/generation/model-product-shoot/composition-references/`
>
> Name it clearly — e.g. `track-hold.jpg`, `postrun-apply.jpg`. Let me know when it's in."

If images are already present, list them and ask which to use.

Wait for the user to confirm before proceeding.

---

## Step 3 — Select product

Ask: "Which product should the model be holding or interacting with?"

Check `brands/[brand-name]/intelligence/product-images/` for a match. Show what was found:
```
Found:
  ✓ roll-on-serum.jpg

Not found:
  ✗ [product name] — not in product images
```

**If not found:**
1. Check `brands/[brand-name]/intelligence/products.json` for the product and its image URL
2. Try to download it:
   ```bash
   curl -L "[product-image-url]" -o "brands/[brand-name]/intelligence/product-images/[slug]-01.jpg"
   ```
3. If the download fails or the product isn't in products.json, create a product upload folder and ask the user:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p brands/[brand-name]/generation/model-product-shoot/product-uploads
   ```
   > "I couldn't find that product image. Drop it into:
   > `brands/[brand-name]/generation/model-product-shoot/product-uploads/`
   > and let me know when it's in."

---

## Step 4 — Select model and styled image

Scan `brands/[brand-name]/generation/models/` for subfolders containing `headshot.png` and `fullbody.png`.

Present available models:
```
Available models:
  • sofia
  • marcus
```

Ask: "Which model would you like to feature?"

Then ask for the **styled image**: a full-length image of this model wearing the outfit for the shot.

Check `brands/[brand-name]/generation/styled/` for any images of the selected model. If there are some, list them and ask which to use (use the highest version number).

If there are none, offer two options:
1. Use the model's `fullbody.png` from `brands/[brand-name]/generation/models/[model-name]/` as is (neutral casting outfit)
2. Drop an image of the model in the outfit into `brands/[brand-name]/generation/model-product-shoot/styled-uploads/` and let me know the filename

---

## Step 5 — Aspect ratio

Ask: "What aspect ratio? Default is `3:4`. Other options: `1:1`, `4:5`, `2:3`, `9:16`, `16:9`."

Use `3:4` if the user doesn't specify.

---

## Step 6 — Name the output

Derive a slug from the model name, product, and reference:
- `sofia-rollerbottle-track`
- `marcus-creatine-postrun`

Use this slug directly.

---

## Step 7 — Write model-product-shoot-spec.json

Create the output folder and write the spec:

```
brands/[brand-name]/generation/model-product-shoot/[output-name]/
  model-product-shoot-spec.json
```

```json
{
  "output_name": "sofia-rollerbottle-track",
  "brand": "acme",
  "product_name": "Roll-On Serum",
  "product_image": "brands/acme/intelligence/product-images/roll-on-serum-01.jpg",
  "composition_reference": "brands/acme/generation/model-product-shoot/composition-references/track-hold.jpg",
  "model_name": "sofia",
  "model_headshot": "brands/acme/generation/models/sofia/headshot.png",
  "styled_image": "brands/acme/generation/styled/sofia-allblack-athletic/sofia-allblack-athletic_v1.png",
  "aspect_ratio": "3:4"
}
```

---

## Step 8 — Generate

Run from the project root:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/model-product-shoot/generate-model-product-shoot.py brands/[brand-name]/generation/model-product-shoot/[output-name]
```

Uploads images in order: composition reference → product → headshot → styled image.

Calls `openai/gpt-image-2.5/sunburst/edit` at max resolution in the chosen aspect ratio.

Cost: ~.12 per image.

---

## Step 9 — Present the result

Tell the user the exact path where the file was saved, e.g.:
`brands/[brand-name]/generation/model-product-shoot/[output-name]/[output-name]_v1.png`

Ask: "Happy with this? Or would you like to regenerate, swap the reference, or try a different product?"

Once the user is happy, suggest the next step:

> "Great shot. If you'd like to animate this into a short video clip, run `/add-motion`."

**To regenerate (same spec):**
```bash
python3 .claude/skills/model-product-shoot/generate-model-product-shoot.py brands/[brand-name]/generation/model-product-shoot/[output-name]
```
Each run saves as the next version — `[output-name]_v1.png`, `[output-name]_v2.png`, etc. Previous outputs are never overwritten.

**To try a different reference:** update `composition_reference` in the spec and re-run.
**To swap the product:** update `product_image` and `product_name` and re-run.
**To change the outfit:** update `styled_image` and re-run.

## Notes

- Image order matters: composition → product → headshot → styled model. The script handles this automatically.
- The reference image is the strongest driver of the output — choose it based on the scene and energy you want, not the product or model in it
- Multiple brands have their own `model-product-shoot/` subfolder — independent workflows can run side by side
- Composition references are shared across all outputs for that brand — reuse them freely
